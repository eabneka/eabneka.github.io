### Concept
Parking tower 2.0  
Real world Parking tower has promising aspects, but also has short commings, that make building one harder.

###### pro
- efficient space usage
- No time spent on searching vacant spot
- less time spent on walking to parked car


###### con
- more expensive than plain parking lot
- hard to scale up horizontally(hence "tower")
- bottle neck design  

By moving parking agency to car itself, overcome these short comings.
